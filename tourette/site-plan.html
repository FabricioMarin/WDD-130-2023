        I will focuse in some testimonies of Linda and her son Lucas. Linda studied a CDC-sponsored Tourette Association of America program on comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics.
        Other experiences will be about Mike, this is some of his introductory words, “My name is Mike Higgins and I am a father, pastor, husband, dean of students at a seminary, minister, colonel in the United States Army and I have Tourette syndrome.”
        Also I will share the experience of Tim Howard , The North Brunswick goalkeeper spent nine years at Everton, after traveling from the United States to England with Manchester United in 2003. He was the goalkeeper of the national team of the American country, but what many people do not know is that he suffered from a disease called Tourette syndrome since childhood. For that reason, his is a story of improvement within football.
